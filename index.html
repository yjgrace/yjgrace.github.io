							<h2>What we learnt about writing THE marriage guide</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Writing this “ultimate guide” to marriage has proven to be particularly insightful for us. What started as an exploratory study on marriage, quickly took the form of a guidebook when we realized the potential value in aggregating the lessons we had learnt. However, to what extent are these nine tips useful to you as a reader?</p>
						<p>Perhaps you found that some tips resonated with you, while others made you raise an eyebrow. Or perhaps you were skeptical even before reading because what qualifies us students, who are not married and will not be anytime soon, to give tips about marriage?</p>
						<p>Indeed, despite our earnest intention to help make future marriages more successful, what was synthesized turned instead into an expression of our thoughts on marriage, with the tips being more of a consolidation of our own views on what makes marriage work. Instead of a guidebook that collates information and informs readers, we had unwittingly written a guidebook to remind <b><em>us</em></b> of what <b><em>we</em></b> should take note of if we were to ever get married. Using our own mentalities and conceptions of what marriage should be (despite us not having any real experience of being in a marriage), we had subconsciously gathered and analyzed the data through a biased lens.</p>
						<p>One instance of this bias is exemplified through the 22 subreddits through our research. 11 discussed marriage advice and the remaining 11 discussing a variety of topics ranging from what marriage feels like, to finding your significant other. Could the large number of advice-related subreddits that we had chosen be attributed to a personal desire to learn more about navigating difficult situations in married life?</p>
						<p>It is possible that advice, which are intended to be objective, cannot be divorced from preconceived notions of marriage that are held subconsciously by advice-givers. The framing of a story, and the act of advice giving tells readers a great deal about the very authors and advice-givers themselves.</p>
						<p>Another instance of the above can be  observed in our tip 8 on “acceptance and tolerance”. This was a nonobvious, and insightful tip for us and we did not previously see the difference between the two concepts. However, if we had been more nuanced in our interpretation of the two terms, this tip would probably not have been viewed as important for us to discuss in the guidebook.</p>
						<p>Looking again at the guidebook as a whole, it now seems to us that the tips fell short of being a useful guide to marriage. The guide barely scratches the surface of the complexities involved in building and maintaining a marriage. In fact, would anyone ever be qualified enough to “figure out marriage? Is it even possible to write a methodical guide to marriage?</p>
						<p>Even if we had in our hands the holy grail of marriage guidebooks, we reckon that that the tips alone contained within that book may not be sufficient for a wonderful marriage. It is true that with the use of machine learning, algorithms are now able to matchmake singles by estimating their best-fit partner based on online profiles. In the not so distant future, this could extend beyond dating websites to recommend partners based on more complex factors such as personality fit. Yet, would being with your ideal partner necessarily translate to a happy marriage?</p>
						<p>Like the dating algorithms, any guidebook would only be a starting point. It is a tool that could increase your chances of having a happy marriage, but as with any tool, its effectiveness lies in the hands of its user.</p>
						<p>It is all up to <b><em>you</em></b> now.</p>
