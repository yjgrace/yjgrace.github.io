						<h3>Tip 7: Communication is important. <em>Why?</em></h3>
						<p>In their paper discussing relationship maintenance, Stafford et al. identifies 7 factors that contribute to satisfaction. These include “advice, assurance, conflict management, openness, positivity, sharing tasks, and social networks”. We surveyed married couples, and asked them for advice to young couples wanting to get married.</p>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>The exploratory nature of this study makes it difficult to replicate the 7 factors outlined by Stafford et al., but we do observe similar themes emerging. Of particular interest was a comment on finding partners of “the same wavelength(s)” which prompted us to wonder - what does this mean? Two waves with the same amplitude, frequency, and wavelength can superimpose, resulting in <em><b>constructive or destructive interference.</b></em></p>
						<p style="color: red;">Include GIF of sine waves</p>
						<p>If we take communication as an analogy for superimposition, good communication can be constructive. Perhaps the 7 factors of Stafford et al. are ways in which communication can be constructive, as opposed to destructive. Taking our survey results as an example, instead of asking your partner why they are moody, get to the root of the problem and manage your conflicts in advance.</p>

						<h3>Tip 8: Know the difference between <em>acceptance</em> and tolerance</h3>
						<p>We asked married couples for their views on happy marriages, and two themes began to surface - tolerance and acceptance. While many respondents use the two interchangeably, it is worthwhile noting that you could tolerate something without accepting it, yet the inverse might not hold. This is particularly relevant in handling important life decisions as a couple; you’d want your partner to accept your career choices (or dispute them for good reason), but it is far less desirable for them to simply tolerate it. While tolerance involves putting up with your partner, acceptance involves a greater sense of “my partner’s thoughts are mine too”. How do we move past tolerance, and towards acceptance?</p>
						<p style="color: red;">Include video of daniel lai</p>
						<p>Instead of putting up with the shortcomings of his partner because his is unable to change them, Daniel was able to take control and consciously accept his partner’s ideals as his own. This seems to be driven by the trust he places in having made the right choice when he “opened both eyes”. Be like Daniel.</p>

						<h3>Tip 9: Love takes on different forms. Don’t go searching for it, <em>it’s there</em>.</h3>
						<p>We asked people to describe marriage and were surprised to find that love wasn’t as commonly discussed as we thought. We also asked them to describe love, and found that there were similarities in the way people described marriage and love.</p>
						<p style="color: red;">Picture of answers talking about commitment</p>
						<p>Respondents are referring to love in the same language used to talk about successful marriages, and topics tend to revolve around mutual understanding or sacrifice. Not being conscious of this fact may lead to one disputing that love exists in a marriage, when instead it is being referred to in different ways.</p>
