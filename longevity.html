							<h1>Making it Last</h1>
						</header>
						<h3>Tip 7: Communication is important. <em>Why?</em></h3>
						<p>In their paper discussing relationship maintenance, Stafford et al. identifies 7 factors that contribute to satisfaction. We asked married couples for their advice to young couples wanting to get married, hoping to observe some of these factors.</p>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/longevity1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p class="annotation">Notice how respondents identify success factors such as conflict management, and (common) social networks, factors proposed by Stafford et al.</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The exploratory nature of this study makes it difficult to replicate the 7 factors outlined by Stafford et al., but similar themes do emerge. Of particular interest was a comment on finding partners of “the same wavelength(s)” which prompted us to wonder - what does this mean? Two waves with the same amplitude, frequency, and wavelength can superimpose, resulting in <em>constructive or destructive interference.</em></p>
						<span class="image main gif"><img src="images/longevity2.gif" alt="" /></span>
						<p>Taking communication as an analogy for superimposition, good communication can be constructive. Perhaps the 7 factors of Stafford et al. are ways communication can be constructive, as opposed to destructive. Instead of asking your partner why they are moody, get to the root of the problem and manage your conflicts in advance.</p>

						<h3>Tip 8: Know the difference between <em>acceptance</em> and tolerance</h3>
						<p>We asked married couples for their views on happy marriages, and two themes began to surface - tolerance and acceptance. While many respondents used the two interchangeably, it is worthwhile noting that you could tolerate something without accepting it, yet the inverse might not hold. When handling important life decisions as a couple, you’d want your partner to accept your career choices (or dispute them for good reason), but it is far less desirable for them to simply tolerate it. While tolerance involves putting up with your partner, acceptance involves a greater sense of “my partner’s thoughts are mine too”. How do we move past tolerance, and towards acceptance?</p>

						<p>Instead of putting up with the shortcomings of his partner because his is unable to change them, Daniel was able to consciously accept his partner’s ideals as his own. This is driven by the trust he places in having made the right choice when he “opened both eyes”. Be like Daniel.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Tip 9: Love takes on different forms. Don’t go searching for it, <em>it’s there</em>.</h3>
						<p>When asked to describe marriage, people didn’t discuss love as commonly as we expected. Yet, when asked to describe love, we found similarities in the way people described the two.</p>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/longevity4.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p class="annotation">The blue rows are our survey answers discussing “commitment”. Even with small samples, people think of similar things when discussing marriage and love.</p>
						<p>Respondents are referring to love in the same language used to talk about successful marriages, and topics tend to revolve around mutual understanding or sacrifice. Not being conscious of this fact may lead to one disputing that love exists in a marriage, when instead it is being referred to in different ways.</p>
