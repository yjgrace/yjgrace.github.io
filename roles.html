						<h3>Tip 4: Ask yourself if marriage is the answer</h3>
						<p>Common responses in our survey of the meaning of marriage associated it with a “lifelong commitment / partnership” and also as “a legitimate way to have a family”. Although, one view voiced the opinion marriage is an outdated institution  and is “mostly just a legal status”, which is not necessarily synonymous with a long-term committed relationship.</p>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						<p>It is easy to dismiss the latter view as an outlier, but the comment reminds us to be aware of what we are looking for in getting married. Is the goal of marriage an end in itself, or are you looking for the things that are commonly associated with marriage instead - a meaning in life; meeting your parents’ expectations; meeting the government’s criteria to apply for housing?</p>
						<p>In Gendler’s video, we saw that ideas of marriage are transformed and shaped by society, but you can bring in your own beliefs and assess your needs before making this big decision too.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Tip 5: Be ready to take on new roles and expectations</h3>
						<p>Marriage involves expectations of raising children and staying monogamous (Gendler, 2014), which are echoed by our survey responses. In addition to this, an analysis of top comments on a marriage-related subreddit revealed practical issues to consider, such as the housing situation and how the wedding expenses were settled.</p>
						<p style="color: red;">Insert video of reddit posts</p>
						<p>The move away from traditional gender-based roles and towards the notion that men and women have identical obligations within a marriage (Drake, 2015) means that you can no longer shrug-off dishwashing duties as a husband, and more wives would enter the workforce to contribute to the household finances.</p>
						<p>The above shed light on how much work is needed, across different domains of life, both before and throughout the marriage. Unfortunately, the honeymoon period will come to an end so planning ahead to fulfil expectations within and outside of the marriage could help you avoid/lessen unnecessary stress that marriage can pile on you.</p>

						<h3>Tip 6: Marriage is not just about you and your partner</h3>
						<p style="color: red;">Insert gif of LDA visualization</p>
						<p>The focus of marriage can move beyond the couple over time, with other factors contributing to creating meaning and sustaining the marriage. A topic model visualisation of all marriage subreddits revealed that people were talking about physical ties (i.e. dad, mom, house/home, sister), in addition to the common marriage topics.</p>
						<p>The previous tip reminds you to be ready to take on new roles and responsibilities, but do remember to also consider your duties beyond your relationship with your partner. While families are getting smaller and people are focusing more on individual pursuits (Gendler, 2014), marriage is not an excuse for overlooking the presence and influence of family members and in-laws, as well as thinking about the changes that having a child can bring to the marriage.</p>
