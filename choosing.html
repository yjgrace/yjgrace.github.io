						<h3>Tip 1: Keep a lookout for your future spouse in school</h3>
						<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BtxWFpiAa4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="margin-bottom: 2em;"></iframe>
						<p class="annotation">Is It Harder Than Ever To Find Love? (Life Noggin, 2016)</p>
						<p>Ready to find your future spouse but not sure where to begin? Our number one tip - keep a lookout when you are still in school! We asked our 40 survey respondents about where they met their spouses and most of them answered school and/or university. Some met their spouses in the workplace, but this proportion of survey respondents is rather small.</p>
						<p>However with globalisation, the internet and online dating, the number of “places” (both online and offline) that you can meet your future spouse has increased. Don’t get too happy though, as the paradox of choice may come into play. The more choices you have, the more likely you will not make a decision or be unhappy with the one that you choose (Life Noggin, 2016). Hence we and our survey respondents recommend to try with your schoolmates first.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Tip 2: Compatibility is key</h3>
						<p>Opposites attract, but when choosing a lifetime, long-term mate, what is key is finding someone who is compatible with you. Our interview with Adrian and Ryan highlighted their views on the importance of having shared values. This is backed up by a study conducted by Wilson, Cousins, and Fink (2006) that found that a higher level of similarity between partners is crucial for a longer relationship and a higher level of satisfaction.</p>
						<p>How do you know if you are compatible enough with your potential spouse? One way would be to take the test developed by Wilson and Cousins (2003) and find out your <a href="https://www.supanet.com/the-compatibility-quotient-test-a5094.html" target="_blank">compatibility quotient</a> (CQ). The alternative would be to tap on your rational minds and truly ask yourself if you have similar values, views and preferences as your partner.</p>
						<p>Interestingly, where does love come into play? 33/40 of our survey respondents failed to mention love when asked to describe marriage in one sentence. We’ll let you ponder about that for now.</p>
						<hr>

						<h3>Tip 3: Listen to advice that other people give</h3>
						<p>We compiled information from various subreddits, and calculated “sentiment scores” for each type of subreddit to gauge whether people generally had positive or negative sentiments regarding the topics surrounding marriage. Half of the 22 subreddits were about relationship and marriage advice. What we discovered was that a lot of advice comes from people who have had experiences, both good and bad. Hence, listen to advice (and listen to us)!</p>
